      <h1>What is bingo</h1>
  <p>At its very simplest bingo involves someone calling a series of random numbers usually found on small tiles or balls selected from a sack or by a bingo machine. Players have cards containing a set amount of numbers. If a number is called which matches one on their card they can cross it off. The first to cross off all their numbers (called a full house) wins.</p>

       <h2>what it involves</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Bingo in various shapes or forms is popular all around the world. Its a really sociable game, lots of fun and easy to organise. This makes it a great fundraiser for churches, schools, sports clubs or any other non-profit organisation. What's more it can also be a fundraiser parents do together with kids.</li>
    <li>This can take many forms depending on the culinary abilities of your group and the facilities at your venue. It is good to include some form of refreshment however to make a real night of it. Often tickets for the Bingo Night can be sold to include some kind of meal.

Things that can be cooked by volunteers in advance and then reheated at the venue are ideal. How about:
Curry
Chili Con Carne
Bolognaise
Soup
If the location allows however you may like to be a bit more adventurous or combine the bingo with something else such as:
Barbecue
Harvest Supper
Fish and Chips
Chicken Fry
Pizza
If your bingo night fundraiser was related to a certain day or festival you could of course include that theme, for instance Irish Stew on St Patrick's Day or something related to sports tournaments such as Supper Bowl for the Super Bowl etc

Drink -You will need to offer some form of drink be it soft drinks, alcohol or simple teas and coffees. With alcohol sometimes its easier to perhaps offer food but allow the venue to supply the bar. Another simple option is to have a BYOB (bring your own bottle) system; this also can get you around licensing requirements. Don't forget to state this on your tickets and advertising.
